# Corset Atelier — Website

Static site (plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, no backend). Deploys as-is to Vercel or GitHub Pages.

```

Every page includes `js/ai-widget.js`, which injects its own markup and
stylesheet — you never need to touch the HTML to add the widget elsewhere.

## How the Custom Builder works

- Six steps, all on one page (`custom-builder.html`), shown/hidden by JS —
  no reloads. State (type, fabric, color, sizing, contact details) lives in
  memory until the final step.
- **Sizing** offers a toggle between standard sizes (XS–XXL) and custom
  measurements (bust/waist/hip/torso in inches) for a true made-to-measure order.
- Each step validates before allowing "Continue" — you can't reach Review
  with missing selections.
- **Review step** shows every selection back, restates the deposit/production/
  cancellation policy, and requires an explicit checkbox agreement before the
  WhatsApp message can be sent.
- Arriving from a product page via "Start Custom Build" carries the product
  name into the Notes field automatically (`custom-builder.html?base=...`).

## How the product pages work

- **`data/products.json`** is the only place product info lives — id, name,
  category, price, comparePrice, fabric, colors, sizes, weight, description,
  and a `swatch` + `gallery` (3 placeholder images) per product. Add a new
  product by adding an object here; it shows up in Collections and gets a
  working detail page automatically at `product.html?id=your-id`.
- **Collections page** filters by `?cat=` in the URL and re-renders client-side.
- **Product page** reads `?id=` from the URL, finds the matching product, and
  renders everything — including "You May Also Like" (same category, excluding
  itself).
- **Wishlist** is one `localStorage` key (`ca_wishlist`) read/written from
  `main.js`, shared by the header badge, product cards, and the product page's
  heart button — toggle it anywhere and it's consistent everywhere.
- **Buy button** opens a modal (name/phone/email/address/city), then builds a
  formatted WhatsApp message with the product, chosen color/size, and those
  details, and opens `wa.me` with it prefilled — no backend involved.
- **Ask a Question button** opens a lighter modal (just a message + name/phone)
  and does the same — a prefilled WhatsApp query about that specific product.
- **Custom Build note** on the product page links to `custom-builder.html`
  (not built yet) with the product name passed along, so a customer can start
  a made-to-measure version of a piece they liked.

## Placeholder visuals

There's no product photography yet, so hero slides, collection tiles, and
product galleries use gradient placeholders in the brand colors instead of
images. Swap them out by:
1. Dropping real photos into `assets/images/`
2. In `data/products.json`, replacing a product's `swatch` and `gallery`
   entries with `url('assets/images/your-photo.jpg')` instead of a
   `linear-gradient(...)` value — the CSS already treats both the same way
   (`background: ...`), so no other code changes needed.
3. Doing the same for the hero slides in `index.html` (`.hero-bg` inline styles).

## Run locally

This site now fetches `data/products.json`, which browsers block over the
`file://` protocol (CORS). You need to serve it locally:
```bash
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server 5500
```
Opening `index.html` directly by double-clicking will work, but
`collections.html` and `product.html` won't load products until served.

Note: `npx serve` and `python3 -m http.server` are plain static servers —
they won't run `api/chat.js`, so the AI widget will show its WhatsApp
fallback locally. To test the AI assistant itself before deploying, use
`vercel dev` instead (after `npm i -g vercel` and setting up `.env` per
the AI Assistant section below).

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo.
2. In Vercel: **Add New Project → Import** the repo.
3. Framework preset: **Other** (it's static — no build command, no output
   directory override needed; Vercel serves the root as-is).
4. Deploy. Done — every push to `main` auto-deploys.

Or via CLI from this folder: `npx vercel`.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo.
2. Repo **Settings → Pages → Source**: select the branch (e.g. `main`) and
   root folder (`/`).
3. Save — GitHub gives you a `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` URL in
   a minute or two.

Both hosts work from the exact same files — no config differences needed
for a plain static site like this.

## What's next (per the phase plan)

- ✅ Phase 0: Foundation (design system, header, footer)
- ✅ Phase 1: Home page
- ✅ Phase 3: Collections hub + category filtering
- ✅ Phase 4: Product detail (gallery zoom, variants, Buy/Query → WhatsApp)
- ✅ Phase 5: Wishlist page
- ✅ Phase 6: Custom Builder
- ✅ Phase 7: Our Story, Custom Order Policy, Size Guide, FAQs, Shipping, Contact
- ✅ Phase 8: AI assistant widget (Gemini)
- Phase 9: Polish pass

## Setting up the AI Assistant (Phase 8)

The assistant is a small chat widget (bottom-right, every page) that talks
to Gemini through a Vercel serverless function — this keeps your API key
off the browser entirely.

**1. Get a free Gemini API key**
Go to https://aistudio.google.com/apikey and create one (no cost on the
free tier for this use case).

**2. Add it to Vercel**
In your Vercel project: **Settings → Environment Variables** → add
`GEMINI_API_KEY` with your key as the value → redeploy.
(For local testing with `vercel dev`, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and
fill it in instead.)

**3. That's it**
`api/chat.js` reads the key server-side, feeds Gemini your live product
catalog plus your sizing/shipping/custom-order policies, and returns
answers to the widget. Nothing else to configure.

### Important: this only works on Vercel

`api/chat.js` is a **Vercel serverless function** — GitHub Pages can't run
server code, so the endpoint won't exist there. The widget is built to
handle this gracefully: if the API call fails, it shows a "message us on
WhatsApp instead" prompt rather than breaking. So the rest of the site
still works fine on GitHub Pages — you'd just lose the live AI chat there.
If you want AI chat on GitHub Pages too, the only way is switching to a
client-side API key (visible in the browser, restrictable by domain in
Google AI Studio) — ask if you'd like that version instead.

### What the assistant knows

It's given your full product catalog (`data/products.json`) plus your
sizing chart, materials/care info, custom order deposit policy, pricing
range, delivery times, and payment method — all defined in the system
prompt inside `api/chat.js`. Update that file's `SYSTEM_PROMPT` whenever
your policies change; the catalog itself stays in sync automatically since
it's read from `products.json` on every request.
